    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>There are a few different types of paragraphs one can write, and we’ll get into that. Just know that no matter
        what type of paragraph you are writing, the action you are undertaking is called paragraphing.The above section
        (starting with “A paragraph” and ending with “…called paragraphing”) is a whole paragraph. Congratulations, you
        just learned your first paragraph-writing lesson.</p>
